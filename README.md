# Monte Carlo Simulations – Beginner Projects

This repository contains beginner-friendly projects that demonstrate Monte Carlo simulations applied to simple problems. 

## Projects

### 1. Estimating the value of pi
- Description: Uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of pi by randomly generating points in a square and counting how many fall inside a quarter circle.
- Script: `src/MC_pi.py`
- Result: Scatter plot showing the points inside and outside the quarter circle.

### 2. Radioactive Decay Simulation
- Description: Simulates the stochastic decay of radioactive particles over time using Monte Carlo methods and compares it with the theoretical exponential decay.
- Script: `src/MC_radioactive_decay.py`
- Result: Plot of simulated decay vs theoretical curve.

### 3.Computing the value of one variable integrals
- Description: Calculates the integral of a function in a defined interval, calculating the relative error.
- Script: `src/MC_integrals.py`
- Result: Plot of simulated and exact curve.

### Future Projects
- More Monte Carlo simulations in science and mathematics
- Applications in physics, chemistry, and data analysis
